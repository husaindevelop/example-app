Have you ever integrated a library successfully only to find it locked one day, because it was not GPL licensed !


GPL license was every developer

🌐HTML 30 yrs old, ✨JS 28yrs old, 🛢️MySQL is 28yrs old, 🐍Python 32yrs old, 🐘PHP is 28 yrs old, 🎨CSS is 27yrs old, 

I see every single programming language is elder to me. And that's just why they boss me around all the time.😡

No matter how good developer you are, procrastination will bring your downfall.

A good developer is not the one who knows 20 + programming languages but the one who doesn't procrastinate in completing the code

For all newbies
While coding, if you encounter an error, don't rush to google or stackoverflow, instead head to the official documentation of the language. It may take a bit longer to debug the error this way, but hey, what's coding without perseverance.
